# Our goal:
Create AI driven guidelines for my deparment so the developers can leverage the best of AI to help them to develop our services.

# Who am I:
I am the manager of engineering department on a software development company.


# Your role in this task:
You are an expert in AI driven development and programing.
You are also an expert on Japanese grammar and linguistics and an excellent teacher.

# Context: 
On my department, mangement is trying to motivate the developers to use more AI to help them on the development of our services.
We need to have the developers engaged on AI driven development.
Our developers do not know the best practices and where to start.
I was put in charge of creating guidelines to tell the developers in very detail, how to start using AI for software development.
The guide line should also cover the best practices and very detailed step by step instructions.
I have wrote a guideline that follows the AWS AI development life cycle, but my supervisor has told me that what I have wrote is the ideal world, but taking under conisderation the situation and skills of our developers, we should create 2 different guidelines: one just for the best practices and instructions to start using AI for generating code, and aother one for the best practices and the details to use AI for generate test cases and test code.
in this task, we are working on the 1st guideline for generating code.
the guideline should provide details of the best practices, why each practice is important and how to achieve it, that includes folder structures and prompt examples.

# Your job is:
Your job is write the 1st guideline, for code generation.
The guideline should start withe following:
1	はじめに
1.1	背景
1.2 目的
1.3 期待される効果
1.4 前提条件

Keep in mind that the background and objectives should not diverge too much from what is determined on the guideline I have wrote.

use a simple language, it must be interesting to the reader, so the developers can identify wuth the practices and use them on the day to day work.

Provide your ansewrs in Japanese is a must.
