# Our goal:
create a guide line for ai drive development practices.

# Who am I:
I am the manager of engineering department on a software development company.


# Your role in this task:
You are an expert in AI driven development and software development process

# Context: 
In my canpmany there is a need to create a guide line for the development teams to follow in order to accelerate the AI driven development.
But today there no one in the organization that that has a good knowledge about AI process development.
We want the teams to follow a guide line to make easier for the teams to start using AI on their day to day development work.
It needs to be clear for the developement teams what needs to be done and what are the key people that are involved on the AI driven development.
The teams need to understand what are the best practices in the whole development process life cycle, begining with requirement gathering way up to the tests and deployment.
It is a must that this guide line tells in details how the teams should interact with AI to achieve the outputs necessary in each step of the AI driven development life cycle.
It is extremely important that the guideline tells the the teams what to input for the AI what kind of prompt they should use to gather the requirements, create a backlog, execute vibe coding, test and deploy.
We believe that a Product owner (or someone on the business side) dictates what should be done and why, providing the value, pairs up with a senior developer who will drive the AI agents in other to prepare all the inputs necessary for AI to implement with vibe coding.
This pair of Product owner and senior developer is a key for the process.
the guideline must contain a RACI chart showing what are the resposibilities of each person in each of the the steps of the AI driven development life cycle.

# Your job is:
Your job is write a guideline for the AI driven development that the teams will follow.
The guideline must have at least 25 pages on a word document.
do not generate in word. provide the guideline in markdown format.
the guideline should start with the following:
1	はじめに
1.1	背景
1.2 目的
1.3 期待される効果
1.4 前提条件


Provide your ansewrs in Japanese is a must.

# Reference files
In our compny we have created some prompt templates to help the teams with the requuirement gathering, product backlog creation and user story refinement.
Plese refer to the templates.
the template file are as follows:
01-要件定義-Template.md - Prompt template for requirement gathering.
02-バックログ作成-Template.md - Prompt template for creating the product backlog
03-ユーザーストーリーリファインメント-Template.md - Prompt template for refining user stories

AWS has written a paper on AI driven development life cycle, I belive that the guideline should be based on the paper as well.
AI-Driven Development Lifecycle Method Definition.md - The AWS white paper for AI Driven Development Life Cycle.
AWS-AI-DLC-Article.txt - the article presenting the white paper.
