# ai-dlc
The objective of this project is to create a guideline for AI Driven Development Life Cycle.
Our company needs to create a guideline for AI-driven development because currently there is no strong knowledge of AI process development within the organization. The purpose of this guideline is to make it easier for development teams to adopt AI in their daily work by providing clear instructions and best practices across the entire software development life cycleâ€”from requirement gathering to testing and deployment.

## Key elements of the guideline:
- Clarity for teams: Define what needs to be done, how to use AI, and which key roles are involved.
- Step-by-step AI usage: Explain in detail how teams should interact with AI at each stage of development (requirements gathering, backlog creation, coding with AI, testing, deployment).
- Prompt design: Provide concrete examples of what inputs/prompts to use with AI for each stage.
- Role definition: Emphasize the collaboration between the Product Owner (or business-side role), who defines what and why (value), and the Senior Developer, who operates AI tools and prepares inputs. This pair is critical to success.
- RACI chart: Include a responsibility matrix to clearly assign roles and responsibilities throughout the AI-driven development life cycle.

## This project has the following folder structure.
- prompts: In this folder all the prompts used to create and edit any files relevant to the guideline are saved here.
- reference: In this folder any refence files that were used to provide insights and inputs to the content on the guideline are saved here.
